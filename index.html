      <h2>About the Podcast</h2>
      <p>
        "Critics at Large" is a weekly culture podcast from The New Yorker that
        dives into today's cultural obsessions, classic works viewed through a
        fresh lens, and the latest trends shaping books, television, film, and
        more. Every Thursday, staff writers Vinson Cunningham, Naomi Fry, and
        Alexandra Schwartz lead lively, thought-provoking discussions that blend
        deep analysis with behind-the-scenes insights from The New Yorker's
        world-renowned reporting. Together, they help listeners make sense of
        our cultural momentâ€”and how we got here.

      <p>
        I've always felt we could learn more about ourselves by looking into art
        and culture. Maybe that's why I've always been so passionate about these
        subjects, even in my early days of journalism. From the moment I
        discovered The New Yorker, I dreamed of becoming a cultural critic,
        exploring the nuances of art, literature, and human behavior. Over time,
        my career and studies evolved, but my passion for these themes only
        deepened. This podcast feels like someone took my thoughts and crafted
        them into a brilliant series. Each episode resonates with my love for
        critical analysis and thoughtful conversation, guiding me through
        cultural trends, profound discussions, and fresh perspectives. Critics
        at Large is truly a blend of everything I value and aspire to in the
        world of culture and storytelling."
