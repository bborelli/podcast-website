        <p>
          Critics at Large is The New Yorker's weekly culture podcast, delving
          into today's cultural fascinations, classic works seen with fresh
          eyes, and the trends shaping books, television, film, and more. But
          for me, this podcast is more than a source of compelling insights—it
          feels as if someone has captured my own aspirations and crafted them
          into this remarkable series.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every Thursday, staff writers Vinson Cunningham, Naomi Fry, and
          Alexandra Schwartz lead discussions that combine deep analysis with
          insider perspectives, helping listeners make sense of our cultural
          moment and the journeys that brought us here. It's an exhilarating
          experience to follow along with them!
        </p>
        <p>
          Since discovering The New Yorker, I've dreamed of becoming a cultural
          critic, diving into the layers of art, literature, and society. As my
          career and studies evolved, my passion for these themes only deepened.
          That's why Critics at Large resonates so strongly with me; it mirrors
          my love for thoughtful conversation and guides me through cultural
          currents and profound discussions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This podcast truly embodies everything I value and aspire to in
          culture and storytelling—an ongoing journey into understanding the
          world. I'd recommend it to anyone with a curious and insatiable soul
          like mine.

            Alexandra Schwartz joined The New Yorker as part of the editorial
            team in 2013 and became a staff writer in 2016. Known for her
            insightful and compelling coverage, she has profiled celebrated

          <h3 class="title">Midlife Crisis</h3>
          <p>
            The critics examine how the midlife crisis, once largely seen as a
            male experience, has evolved with societal shifts since the women's
            rights movement, leading to a new archetype. The hosts discuss how
            novels like Miranda July's All Four have redefined the genre for the
            modern age. “I think the crisis of midlife,” Schwartz notes, “is
            just the crisis of life, period. You invent it for yourself.”

          <h3 class="title">The Therapy</h3>
          <p>
            In this episode, the critics explore portrayals of therapy, from
            Woody Allen's works and The Sopranos to newer representations in
            Shrinking and Couples Therapy. They discuss how mental-health
            awareness has grown, with the rise of therapists on social media
            putting psychoanalytic language and concepts into the hands of a
            broader audience. But is the therapy boom making us better?

          <h3 class="title">The Substance</h3>
          <p>
            The critics discuss Coralie Fargeat's film theme whereas delving
            into society's obsession with physical form. “We are embodied. It is
            a struggle. It is beautiful. It's something to wrestle with forever.
            Just as you think that you've caught up to your current embodiment,
            something changes,” Schwartz says.
