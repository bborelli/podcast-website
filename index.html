        <h2>About the Podcast</h2>
        <p>
          "Critics at Large" is a weekly culture podcast from The New Yorker
          that dives into today's cultural obsessions, classic works viewed
          through a fresh lens, and the latest trends shaping books, television,
          film, and more. Every Thursday, staff writers Vinson Cunningham, Naomi
          Fry, and Alexandra Schwartz lead lively, thought-provoking discussions
          that blend deep analysis with behind-the-scenes insights from The New
          Yorker's world-renowned reporting. Together, they help listeners make
          sense of our cultural momentâ€”and how we got here.

        <p>
          I've always felt we could learn more about ourselves by looking into
          art and culture. Maybe that's why I've always been so passionate about
          these subjects, even in my early days of journalism. From the moment I
          discovered The New Yorker, I dreamed of becoming a cultural critic,
          exploring the nuances of art, literature, and human behavior. Over
          time, my career and studies evolved, but my passion for these themes
          only deepened. This podcast feels like someone took my thoughts and
          crafted them into a brilliant series. Each episode resonates with my
          love for critical analysis and thoughtful conversation, guiding me
          through cultural trends, profound discussions, and fresh perspectives.
          Critics at Large is truly a blend of everything I value and aspire to
          in the world of culture and storytelling."
